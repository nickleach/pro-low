## Welcome to My Angular Project

> I am your Readme.md file, you should probably update me.


## Usage

This template contains some simple `gulp` tasks. They are as follows:

- `gulp watch`: This will launch a Node Server and start the standard `watchlist` task
- `gulp bower`: This will move the bower components into their proper location. This will run during the `watch` task, but you may need to run it manually once in a while


## Babel

This template is set up to make use of ES2015 (ES6) and using Babel as a transpiler. You will write all of your code in your `main.js` file and that will compile/transpile down to an `app.js` file which is read by your `index.html` file.

This build requires the use of [ES2015 Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

## Lastly

There are many more tasks, and you really should read through the `gulpfile.js`, but the ones above will take care of you in most cases.
